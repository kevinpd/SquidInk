                        A digital agency specialising in front-end development
                    </h1>
                    <p class="intro">Welcome to SquidInk, where we pride ourselves on getting messy when producing nothing but the highest standard work. Founded in 2018, we are a digital agency based in the heart of Manchester that has worked on many projects both large
                        and small for many leading brands and agencies. We have a talented team that specialises in front-end development, with a clear focus on providing responsive and accessible websites.</p>

            <h2>Our work process</h2>
            <p>Here at SquidInk we follow a few fundemental steps to ensure that we produce high standard websites for our clients. Our five steps include producing a styleguide. A styleguide is a guide used to document the visual language our websites wants
                to follow.</p>

            <p>We then gather user research to gain a deeper understanding into what our audience would want from the website guide that we'll be building. We will then undergo design research to ensure the content and colour of a page is communicated the
                way we intend to on each page.

                <p>Shortly before making a website live, we will undergo usability testing to gather the success and flaws of the site we are making. The final step we take before making a site live, we undergo a quality audit, where we test the sites accessibility
                    and then we test the site's cross-browser compatibility.</p>
