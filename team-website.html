                    <p style="font-family:'Permanent Marker',cursive;">Welcome to SquidInk, where we pride ourselves on getting messy when producing nothing but the highest standard work. Founded in 2018, we are a digital agency based in the heart of Manchester that has worked on many projects both large
                        and small for many leading brands and agencies. We have a talented team that specialises in front-end development, with a clear focus on providing responsive and accessible websites.</p>

            <p>Here at SquidInk we follow a few fundemental steps to ensure that we produce high standard websites for our clients. Our five steps include producing a <strong>styleguide</strong>. A styleguide is a guide used to document the visual language
                our websites wants to follow. We then gather <strong>user research</strong> to gain a deeper understanding into what our audience would want from the website guide that we'll be building. We will then undergo <strong>design research</strong>                to ensure the content and colour of a page is communicated the way we intend to on each page. Shortly before making a website live, we will undergo <strong>usability testing</strong> to gather the success and flaws of the site we are making.
                The final step we take before making a site live, we undergo a <strong>quality audit</strong>, where we test the sites accessibility and then we test the site's cross-browser compatibility.</p>
